<h2>Legal</h2>
<p>Often a designer will not be able to meet the client in person to sign the contract. Note that a contract must be signed by a person with the authority to do so. If you are dealing with a company, be sure to include the name of the company and the name and title of the individual with authority to sign the contract. It is a good idea to have your client sign the contract first. Send two copies of the contract to your client to sign and return to you. Then sign both copies and return one copy to the client. Because you are the last one to sign, you have the advantage of deciding whether or not to sign and make the contract binding.
<br>
Another option is to send signed copies of your contract to your client to sign and return. This puts you at a disadvantage by allowing the client to delay signing and potentially hold up your work on the project. If you send a pre-signed contract to a client you may revoke the contract any time before the client signs. You can also provide an expiration clause that gives the client a deadline in which to sign.</p>
<ul>
<li>Summary of the project or work to be undertake</li>
<li>Clear scope of the project or work</li>
<li>What are both parties agreeing to do?</li>
<li>What are the design elements that are included in the contract</li>
<li>Is the text content of the web design project included or not?</li>
<li>Who will provide photography, videos and who will own the copyrights? Are stock photography accepted? Should images used have a particular license or not?</li>
<li>Who will program, debug, and update HTML, CSS and JavaScript and other coding elements?</li>
<li>Who will perform browser testing on all platforms, and then make any changes necessasry?</li>
<li>Who will provide different (responsive) device browsers testing (desktop vs tablet vs mobile) and who will be responsible for any changes?</li>
<li>Will technical support be included in the web design contract? For how long? Will there be any extra charges under specific conditions?</li>
<li>Who is responsible for changes and revisions</li>
<li>Any legal stuff recommended by your lawyer</li>
<li>Who will own the copyrights and intellectual property of the code and designs?</li>
<li>How will payments will be made and the schedule of payments</li>
<li>How the transfer of information will be handled</li>
<li>The dotted line â€“ all of that signature and dates when the web design contract came into effect</li>
</ul>
