<p>I met a guy that was looking to buy some Bitcoin from me. Friend introduced us. Since, he has contracted with me some interesting projects to work on.</p>
<p>Most projects are classified. Operations include OSINT gathering.</p>
<p>Examples of work:</p>
<p><b><a href='#'>Text-If-Change.py</a></b> - A tool used to fetch a webpage periodically, and if there is any difference in the page, it will set off a loop that will send a text message every 5 seconds.</p>
