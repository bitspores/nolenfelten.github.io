<p><b>Previous Employeers</b></p>

<li><b>Anonymous</b></li>
<p>I met a guy that was looking to buy some Bitcoin from me. Friend introduced us. Since, he has contracted with me some interesting projects to work on.</p>
<p>Most projects are classified. Operations include OSINT gathering. Nothing offensive. He's a great guy!</p>
<p>Examples of work:</p>
<p><b><a href='#'>Text-If-Change.py</a></b> - A tool used to fetch a webpage periodically, and if there is any difference in the page, it will set off a loop that will send a text message every 5 seconds.</p>
<p>What stands out about this project is the Client <-> Developer interaction.
I just so happened to have written a <a href="https://github.com/nolenfelten/SMS-Bomb/blob/master/SMS%20Bomber.py">script</a> that simply spams phone numbers with text messages using SMTP protocol.</p>
So I quickly hacked it as a template, and was able to build the whole gizmo as fast as the client was describing it over facebook.</p>
