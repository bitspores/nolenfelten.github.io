<p><center><h1>Sonoma County UFO Report</h1></center></p>

<p>My name is Nolen Felten, I am a Programmer that decieded to start recording events that has been happening locally. I realize that I am shooting myself in the foot by writing about this without any background in journalism.</p>
<p>The intentions of writing this report is to observe the volume and frequency of sightings that I have been collecting. The dialog contained is just too real. So are the people I have interviewed, and there professional titles.</p>
<br>
<p>A good place to start with how I came about this topic would be when I was walking one evening in September. </p>
