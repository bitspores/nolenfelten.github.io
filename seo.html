  <h1>Search Engine Optimization</h1>
  <p>"The slice of bread of the internet world." - Eli The Computer Guy</p>
  <p><b>Search Engine Optimization</b> is making your page look better for Google. Each page in Google index has something called the <b>Page Rank</b>. <b>Page Rank</b> is the score that determines what page shows up first in a Google search.</p>
  <p>SEO is a competitive industry. There is good money to be made by everyone! Bidding wars can erupt. SEO is also ever changing.</p>
  <p>Use full (http://nolenfelten.github.io) path in href rather then (./index.html).</p>
  <p>Why is SEO cool?</p>
  <p>Eli shows examples where his business still shows up as number 1 after he closed his business. <u>He used this to refer business he was getting to other consultants for comission</u>.</p>
  <h2>Google is all that matters.</h2>
  <p>Google uses over 800 variables to render Page Rank.</p>
  <p>They are secretive about them. You can use common sense to think of a few. Make it better to the vistors to increase rank.</p>
  <p>Use alt tags on image elements so google can read it. :)</p>
  <h2>Use heading tags</h2>
  <p>Use 2:1 ratio of paragraphs to heading tags.</p>
  <p>They use headings ffor keywords more then paragraph tags.</p>
  <h2>Google Webmaster Tools</h2>
  <p>Enter business information.Like phone and address.</p>
  <p>Once the location is known, they list y our business locally. You enter the game.

  <p>Analyze traffic soures.</p>
  <h2>Google Local Business</h2>
