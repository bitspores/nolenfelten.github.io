<h2>What Is Marketing:</h2>

<p>Market research (also in some contexts known as Industrial Research) is any organized effort to gather information about target markets or customers. It is a very important component of business strategy.</p>
<p>Market research began to be conceptualized and put into formal practice during the 1920s, as an offshoot of the advertising boom of the Golden Age of radio in the United States. Advertisers began to realize the significance of demographics revealed by sponsorship of different radio programs.</p>

<h1>Writing a market plan</h1>

<h3>Why?</h3>

<p><b>There is lots at stake.</b></p>
<p>Writing a plan is essential.</p>

<p><u>The most vital part aspect of any business is the marketing function.</u></p>

<p>A business can't get off the ground unless it sells something.</p>

<p>A marketing plan is a roadmap for running and cordinating marketing programs. <br>It helps align people and organizations in commericaling the products and services.</p>

<h3>We must document the planning process</h3>

<p>It doesnt have to be a long document, it just has to answer these questions:</p>

<h2>Who are we?</h2>

<p>Are we a 4-star restaurant? Do we identify as that? Should our prices and services reflect that?</p>



<h2>Where are we now?</h2>

<h3>Valueate Company</h3>

<iframe width="400" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8OCjwBkMJ_E" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>Asset = Product/Value. Can Can be a digital item. Can be an idea like a sock company. </p>
<p>Equity = Assets that company owners own.</p>
<p>Liability = State of being responsible.</p>
<p>Insurance = The transference of risk.</p>
<p>Valuation = Total value.</p>
<p>Venture = A risky or daring journey or undertaking.</p>
<p>Angel Investor = (also known as a business angel, informal investor, angel funder, private investor, or seed investor) is an affluent individual who provides capital for a business start-up, usually in exchange for convertible debt or ownership equity.</p>
<p>Pre-money Valuation = Valuation of a company or asset prior to an investment or financing. If an investment adds cash to a company, the company will have different valuations before and after the investment.</p>
<p>Post-money Valuation = Company's value after outside financing and/or capital injections are added to its balance sheet. Post-money valuation refers to a company's valuation after funds, such as investments from venture capitalists or angel investors have been added to the balance sheet.</p>

<h2>Where are we going?</h2>

<h2>How do we get there?</h2>



<p>Run Test</p>

<p>To start, gather what we currently know about the market.</p>

<p>- What is the market we are in, exactly?
	<br>4th Street</p>

<p>- What is the competition?
	<br>4th Street</p>

<p>- Who are the customers?
	<br>4th Street</p>

<p>This is critical because it will serve as the supporting edvidence for the stragey we persue.
	<br>It sets the direction to move toward and gets everyone on the same page.
	<br>The written plan becomes the source document for presentations, how to conduct training, and give directions to anyone we outsource to.
	<br>It lays out operations, schedules, and budgets.</p>


<p>A marketing plan is a dynamic document that needs to be updated.
	<br>Date drafts and revisions.
	<br>Changes need to be made as conditions change to stay ahead.</p>

<h1>5 steps to write the plan</h1>


<h2>Step 1: Analyze</h2>

<h3>Most Resturants SUCK at Marketing</h3>

<p>Resturants usually just focus on making their product.</p>

<p>Explore important issues about market conditions, potential customers, and competition. This is called Situation Analysis.</p>

<p>Market Analysis can be defined as:
<br>Estimating how many potential customers you might sell your products and services to.</p>

<p>Types of customers:
	<br>1. Already buy from you.
	<br>2. Buy same product from competition.
	<br>3. Potential customers not buying from either.
	<br>Estimate potential number for each group.</p>

<p>There are two major types of market research.
<br>One is <b>Primary Research</b>, which is sub-divided into Quantitative and Qualitative Research. 
<br>Two is <b>Secondary Research</b>.</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Primary Research</b></li>
	<p>Carried out to answer specific issues or questions. 
	<br>It can involve questionnaires, surveys or interviews with individuals or small groups.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Qualitave Research</li>
		<p>Focus groups. Consult with members of target market. Target Markets are the people who are going to buy product. Profiling possible unfound target members (like women of an age range). Create hypothesis.</p>
		<p>Qualitative Research is primarily exploratory research. It is used to gain an understanding of underlying reasons, opinions, and motivations. It provides insights into the problem or helps to develop ideas or hypotheses for potential research.</p>

		<li>Quantative Research</li>
		<p>Test hypothesis from Qualitave Research with more members of Target Market to develop theories. Conduct experiments which produce results, like surveys.</p>
	</ul>

	<li><b>Secondary Research</b></li>
	<p><b>Secondary Research</b> involves the summary, collation and/or synthesis of existing research rather than <b>Primary</b>, in which data are collected from.<br> For example, research subjects or experiments.</p>
</ul>




<h2>Step 2: Stratgey</h2>
<p>Layout approach to Market Segmetation, Customer Targeting, and how we will position ourselves in the marketplace.</p>


<h1>Business Growth Stragies</h1>

<ul>
	<li>
		<h2>Penetration Marketing</h2>
	</li>

	<p>Often the hardest part of marketing is gaining a foothold for your product or service. </p>


	<div>
		<h2> Market Penetration Defined</h2>
		<p><b>Market penetration</b> is both a measure and a strategy.
			<br>A business will utilize a market penetration strategy to attempt to enter a new market. The goal is to get in quickly with your product or service and capture a large share of the market.
			<br>Market penetration is also a measure of the percentage of the market that your product or service is able to capture. </p>
		<h2> Market Penetration Tactics</h2>
		<p>Aggressive pricing is a very common tactic. You can use <b>penetration pricing</b>, which is setting the price of your product or services lower than that of your competitors.</p>
		<p>This strategy may work well in price-sensitive markets. You may be able to maintain a decent level of profits due to the volume of sales decreasing your costs per unit for the product.
			<p>Additionally, once you have obtained your market share goal and have achieved a sufficient level of brand loyalty, you may be able to increase prices. </p>
			<p>You can also achieve market penetration through <b>aggressive marketing campaigns</b> and <b>distribution strategies</b>.
				<br>For example, you may saturate the market with an aggressive advertising campaign consisting of TV, radio and direct mailing ads. You may also penetrate the market by saturating your product in the market.</p>
			<br>For example, in some cities, it seems there's a Starbucks on every street corner. </p>
		<h2>Advantages of Market Penetration</h2>
		<p>Advantages of market penetration pricing include: </p>

		<ul>
			<li>It may cause quick diffusion and adoaption of your product in the market.
				<br>If your product is cheap enough and of similar quality to competing products, it should spread out into the market and be purchased by customers quickly. </li>
			<li>It may create goodwill among the first customers that purchase the product due to the aggressive pricing. This may create customer referrals. </li>
			<li>Efficiency is encouraged because of thinner profit margins due to the aggressive pricing. Efficiency will be needed to maintain profitability. </li>
			<li>It may discourage competitors from entering the market. </li>
			<li>If there is high product turnover for a distributor due to fast sales, it may help create enthusiasm for your product from the distributors of the product, such as retailers. </li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Disadvantages of Market Penetration</h2>
		<p>Market penetration pricing does present some disadvantages: </p>
		<ul>
			<li>There will be lower profit margins. If you are not in a position to lower production costs, an increase in sales may not lead to profits. </li>
			<li>Aggressive pricing may adversely affect your company image if you are trying to put forth an image of quality and luxury, for example. Additionally, your customers may become accustomed to low pricing and not purchase your product if you increase the price. </li>
			<li>You may start a pricing war in which competitors cut prices, so you have to cut your prices further, and so on. This may result in no profit and a failure to successfully penetrate the market. If you can't make a profit in the long run, there's no reason to enter a market. </li>
			<li>The strategy will not work well where the industry already uses low pricing. </li>
			<li>The strategy will work well if the products are quickly consumed requiring frequent purchases, such as with groceries, but it is not well-suited for products that are rarely purchased, such as a car. </li>
		</ul>

		<li>
			<h1>Market Development</h1>
		</li>

		<h2>Diversification and New Product Development</h2>

		<p>Market development is a growth strategy that identifies and develops new market segments for current products. A market development strategy targets non-buying customers in currently targeted segments.
			<br>It also targets new customers in new segments.</p>


		<p>Companies sometimes diversify their business activities to manage risk or expand into new markets.</p>

		<h2>What is Diversification?</h2>

		<p><b>Diversification</b> occurs when a business develops a new product or expands into a new market.
			<br>Often, businesses diversify to manage risk by minimizing potential harm to the business during economic downturns.
			<br>The basic idea is to expand into a business activity that doesn't negatively react to the same economic downturns as your current business activity.
			<br>If one of your business enterprises is taking a hit in the market, one of your other business enterprises will help offset the losses and keep the company viable.
			<br>A business may also use diversification as a growth strategy. </p>

		<h2>Strategies for Diversification</h2>

		<p>There are different <b>diversification strategies</b> a company may employ.
			<br>Concentric diversification. A company may decide to diversify its activities by expanding into markets or products that are related to its current business.
			<br>An advantage to this approach is due to the complementary products and markets.
		</p>

		<p>Another strategy is conglomerate diversification.
			<br>If a company is expanding into industries that are unrelated to its current business, then it's engaging in conglomerate diversification.
			<br>Conglomerate diversification is a good means to manage risk as long as you can effectively manage each business, which leads us to the disadvantage. Management may not have the skills or experience to manage the new enterprises. </p>

		<p>While you can hire new management, there will still be administrative problems with running different types of businesses, such as competition between the different businesses for resources. </p>

		<p>Businesses may also engage in vertical integration.
			<br>This is when a company diversifies by purchasing or starting businesses that supply its original businesses with raw materials, equipment, parts, and services.
			<br>You're basically trying to control as many of the stages of production as possible by removing the middlemen.</p>

<h2>Step 3: Tactics</h2>
<p>Product or Service operations, Pricing Approch, Promotion Marketing Communication Operations, and Channel Design. The 4 P's of our Marketing Plan.</p>


<h3>4 P's of Marketing</h3>

<p>Factors that the business can control. Business marketing is the focus of tuning these factors to maximize success.</p>
<ul>


	<li>1. Product</li>
	<p>Products are items or services with features.
		<br>Features are oppertunities to diversify different products value and find an unmeet need that is in demand.</p>
	<p>Packaging, warrenties, what channel to sell on, after sale service.</p>
	<p><u>The first step in Marketing is to find the unmeet need</u>. To do this, Marketing Research is conducted. Lots of successful products solve a need before the target market knows it exist.</p>

	<p>Product Segmentation is done by features. Products are under a brand.</p>

	<p>Cost vs. Benefits</p>



	<h3>Product Life-Cycle Management (PLM)</h2>
		<p><b>Product Life-cycle Management</b> is the succession of strategies by business management as a product goes through its life-cycle.
			<br>There are the following major product life-cycle stages:
			<br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/FBieMYf.png">
		</p>

		<p>The goals of <b>Product Life-cycle Management</b> are to reduce time to market, improve product quality, reduce prototyping costs, identify potential sales opportunities and revenue contributions, and reduce environmental impacts at end-of-life.
			<br>To create successful new products the company must understand its customers, markets and competitors.
			<br><b>Product Life-cycle Management</b> integrates people, data, processes and business systems.
			<br>It provides product information for companies and their extended supply chain enterprise.</p>

		<h2>Demand for goods and services</h2>
		</div>
		
		<div>
			<div class="paragraph">
				Economists use the term <strong>demand</strong> to refer to the amount of some good or service consumers are willing and able to purchase at each price. Demand is based on needs and wants—a consumer may be able to differentiate between a need and a want, but from an economist’s perspective they are the same thing. Demand is also based on ability to pay. If you cannot pay, you have no effective demand.
			</div>
		</div>
		<div>
			<div class="paragraph">
				What a buyer pays for a unit of the specific good or service is called <strong>price</strong>. 
				<br>The total number of units purchased at that price is called the <strong>quantity demanded</strong>.
				<br>A rise in price of a good or service almost always decreases the quantity demanded of that good or service. 
				<br>Conversely, a fall in price will increase the quantity demanded. 
				<br>When the price of a gallon of gasoline goes up, for example, people look for ways to reduce their consumption by combining several errands, commuting by carpool or mass transit, or taking weekend or vacation trips closer to home. 
				<br>Economists call this inverse relationship between price and quantity demanded the <em>law of demand</em>.
				<br>The law of demand assumes that all other variables that affect demand are held constant.
			</div>
		</div>
		</div>
		<p>The law of demand states that if all other market factors remain constant, a relative price increase leads to a drop in quantity demanded.</p>
		<p>The price sensitivity of a product varies with the level of importance consumers place on price relative to other purchasing criteria. For example, customers seeking top quality goods are typically less price sensitive than bargain hunters.</p>



		<hr>

		<h3>Elasticity of Demand:</h3>
		<p><b>High elasticity</b> means consumers are more willing to <u>buy a product even after price increases</u>.</p>
		<p><b>Inelastic demand</b> means <u>even small price increases may significantly lower demand</u>.</p>


		<iframe width="620" height="348" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-oClpRv7msg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

		<p>A product is worth as much as the customer is willing to pay.
			<br>We want to identify the price the customer is willing to pay.</p>
		<p>An <b>Elastic Market</b> is a market that is <u><b>Price</b> sensative</u>.
			<br>Price sensitivity is the degree to which the price of a product affects consumers purchasing behaviors.
			<br>In economics, price sensitivity is commonly measured using the price elasticity of demand.</p>
		<p>One way around needing to measure elasticity is to follow the Wal-Mart way, offering unbeatable price to close competition.
			<br>Microsoft made a -$50 loss per sale of the Original Xbox, and used product diversification to sell games with features that other competitors could not beat. This investment from Microsoft cornered the market for the next release of products, the Xbox 360, which were manufactured at lower quality and price, however, the Target Market was established using Xbox Live.</p>

		<li>4. Promotion/Advertising</li>
		<p>Promotion is the process of communicating with your customers, both potential and existing, about your products and services.</p>
		<p>Promotion has three main objectives, attract new customers, turn first time customers into regulars, and increase check averages.</p>
		<p>A constant goal in advertisement is to minimialize waste.</p>
		<p>Segmentation decides how this is played out.</p>
		<p>Social Engineering. Lead generation and lead retention.</p>
		<p>Direct advertisement is telling the customer to visit a website to learn about the product.</p>
		<p>High Quality items must have documation to prove it.</p>
		
		<p><b>External Methods</b>
		<br><i>1. Advertising.</i>
